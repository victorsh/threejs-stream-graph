Instructions:
The assignment was primarily constructed and tested with Chrome.
Given that chrome does not allow the loading of local data, I had to create a server using node.js 
to be able to load the bitcoin JSON data.

To run the server please install nodejs, this open a Command Prompt at the folder containing the app.js file
Enter the command: node app.js, There should be a confirmation that the server is running on http://localhost:8080
The server is already set to load the stream graph at the index of the server so all that has to be done at this
point is to open up a web browser (preferably chrome) and enter the URL http://localhost:8080

The assignment is also available on my public web server provided by UCSC at people.ucsc.edu/~vshahbaz/stream_graph
